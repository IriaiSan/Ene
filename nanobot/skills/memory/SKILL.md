# Memory

Your memory is managed through dedicated tools. Do NOT use file tools to edit memory files directly.

## Core Memory (always loaded)
Use `save_memory`, `edit_memory`, `delete_memory` to manage what stays in your active context.

## Long-term Memory (searchable)
Use `search_memory` to recall archived facts, past reflections, and old entries.

## Subconscious (automatic)
Facts are extracted, diary entries written, and reflections generated automatically. You don't manage this.
